* The alternative seems to be some `process.env` type variables and some `foo`

* 
* The need to get and set project name, etc. makes me wonder if we should create

* maybe it comes to mind because I'm used to asking for `env_vars.CAPS_CASE`. Another

// to make the sessions retrievable (though if you're using `interview_list()`
// you can get them anyway), it also has inconsistent behavior when
// `sessions are unique`` or `temporary session` or use `interview_list()`
// and/or respond immediately with a `command()`. Three ways to avoid this:
// 1. x Start a new browser instead of just a new page each time. Lengthens the tests.
// 1. âˆš Visit `/user/sign-out` (needed even if the user is not logged in)
// 1. x (seems to be causing a 'Unable to locate interview session' error
// instead) Use `reset=2` instead , which will not save the previous session at all. It
// Will not just restart any existing interview sessions, it will also
// clear out the browser session's memory of what other interviews the user has
// visited in the same browser session.
