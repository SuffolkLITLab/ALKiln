// 1. x Start a new browser instead of just a new page each time. Lengthens the tests.
// 1. âˆš Visit `/user/sign-out` (needed even if the user is not logged in)
// 1. x (seems to be causing a 'Unable to locate interview session' error
// instead) Use `reset=2` instead , which will not save the previous session at all. It
// Will not just restart any existing interview sessions, it will also
// clear out the browser session's memory of what other interviews the user has
