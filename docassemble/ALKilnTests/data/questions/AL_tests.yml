# Necessary to tell us what the sought var is on each page
# Every interview that wants testing will need to have an element like this
default screen parts:
  post: |
    <div data-variable="${ encode_name(str( user_info().variable )) }" id="trigger" aria-hidden="true" style="display: none;"></div>

id: interview order
mandatory: True
code: |
  users[0].name.first
  users[0].address.address
  users[1].name.first
  end

id: field code mix
sets:
  - users[i].name.first
question: |
  Mix of code and proxy var
subquestion: |
  The name fields variables will be using `users[0]` while the last field
  will be using `users[i]`. The sought variable will be using
  `users[0]`. The testing framework needs to be able to handle that.
fields:
  - code: |
      users[i].name_fields()
  - A proxy var: users[i].proxy_var

id: end

question: Great test!
